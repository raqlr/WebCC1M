        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a computer science freshman at the University of Vila Velha. This is my first attempt to build a website. Behold my skills haha.</p>
        <p>My name is Raquel Rigoni de Brito Costa. I was born and raised in Brazil. When I was 10 years old, I moved to Vancouver - BC, where I lived until 18. I graduated from Windermere Secondary School in 2019 and enrolled in Psychology at Lusófona University in Lisbon - Portugal in 2021. And now, I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Vila Velha in Brazil. It has been a wild ride haha. </p>
        <p>I have a great interest in science and technology development, specifically the advances in outer space technology. Outside of work I enjoy playing video games, designing web/app layouts, and listening to podcasts about astronomy.</p>
